# Pushgateway in Prometheus

The Pushgateway is a service provided in the Prometheus ecosystem that allows you to push metrics from short-lived jobs or ephemeral processes that might not exist long enough to be scraped by Prometheus directly. It acts as a middle layer, temporarily holding the metrics that Prometheus can scrape at its convenience.

---

## How It Works:
1. **Short-lived jobs** (e.g., batch jobs, cron jobs) push their metrics to the Pushgateway using the Prometheus text-based exposition format (via HTTP POST or PUT).
2. The Pushgateway stores these metrics with a specified set of labels.
3. Prometheus scrapes the Pushgateway at regular intervals to collect the stored metrics.

## Use Cases for Pushgateway

### 1. Short-Lived Batch Jobs
- **Example**: A daily ETL pipeline that runs for 10 minutes and then terminates.
- **Problem**: Prometheus cannot scrape metrics from a process that terminates quickly.
- **Solution**: The job pushes its metrics to the Pushgateway, ensuring the metrics are available when Prometheus scrapes.

### 2. CI/CD Pipelines
- **Example**: A Jenkins job or a GitLab CI pipeline that builds and deploys code.
- **Problem**: Build processes are transient and don't expose metrics directly.
- **Solution**: Push the job's status, duration, or results to the Pushgateway for tracking.

### 3. Custom Monitoring for Non-Persistent Services
- **Example**: A script that runs periodically to check a third-party API's health or response time.
- **Problem**: Thereâ€™s no always-running application to expose metrics.
- **Solution**: The script pushes its metrics to the Pushgateway.

### 4. Jobs Running in Serverless Architectures
- **Example**: A Lambda function or other FaaS implementation that runs on-demand.
- **Problem**: These functions do not have a persistent endpoint for Prometheus to scrape.
- **Solution**: Push metrics to the Pushgateway.

### 5. Event-Driven Systems
- **Example**: A system where certain events trigger temporary processing.
- **Problem**: These ad-hoc processes cannot directly expose metrics to Prometheus.
- **Solution**: Push metrics about the event and its processing to the Pushgateway.

## Key Points to Remember:

### 1. Pushgateway is not for long-lived services:
- Long-lived services should expose their metrics directly and be scraped by Prometheus.

### 2. Metrics in Pushgateway are not ephemeral:
- Once metrics are pushed, they stay there until explicitly deleted or overwritten. This can lead to stale metrics if not managed properly.

### 3. Labeling Best Practices:
- Use meaningful labels (like `job`, `instance`, or custom tags) to avoid conflicts and make metrics easily distinguishable.

### 4. Avoid Overusing:
- Pushgateway adds complexity. Use it only when direct scraping isn't feasible.

By integrating the Pushgateway thoughtfully, you can extend Prometheus's capabilities to monitor ephemeral workloads effectively.
