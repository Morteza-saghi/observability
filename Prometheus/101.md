## Introduction

Prometheus is a powerful open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed primarily for reliability and scalability. Prometheus collects and stores metrics as time-series data, with each data point containing the metric name, timestamp, and value. Itâ€™s particularly well-suited for monitoring cloud infrastructure and distributed applications.

Prometheus is often the first layer in a monitoring stack, acting as the metrics collection and alerting solution. It works seamlessly with other tools, like Grafana for visualization and Alertmanager for advanced alerting capabilities.

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus was initially developed by SoundCloud and is now a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It is designed to:
- Be simple to set up and easy to extend.
- Efficiently handle high cardinality (large number of unique combinations of label values).
- Provide powerful querying capabilities with PromQL.

Prometheus operates on a "pull" model for metrics, scraping defined targets at regular intervals. This approach gives it more control over data collection and reduces the risk of missing data if services are overloaded.

## Core Concepts of Prometheus

### Metrics

Metrics in Prometheus are the fundamental data points collected, usually in a time-series format, and can be classified into four types:

1. **Counter**: A monotonically increasing value, which is reset on restart (e.g., number of requests).
2. **Gauge**: A value that can go up and down (e.g., temperature, memory usage).
3. **Histogram**: Measures the distribution of values (e.g., request durations).
4. **Summary**: Similar to a histogram but provides quantiles (e.g., 95th percentile of request duration).

### Data Model

Prometheus uses a multi-dimensional data model that lets you track metrics with unique labels, called time-series identifiers. Each time-series in Prometheus is uniquely identified by a metric name and an optional set of key-value pairs called **labels**.

Example:
```
http_requests_total{method="POST", handler="/api"} 2307
```

### PromQL

PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is the language used to query metrics in Prometheus. It allows you to retrieve and aggregate data across multiple time-series. Some common queries include:

- **Sum of a metric**: `sum(http_requests_total)`
- **Rate of increase over time**: `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`
- **Average over time**: `avg_over_time(cpu_usage[1h])`

### Targets

Targets are endpoints that Prometheus scrapes for metrics. These are defined in the configuration file and can be specified as either static or dynamic targets, using service discovery methods like Consul, Kubernetes, or DNS.

## Setting Up Prometheus

### Installation

1. **Download** the Prometheus binary from the [official Prometheus website](https://prometheus.io/download/).
2. **Extract** the tarball and run the binary:

```
tar -xvf prometheus-*.tar.gz
cd prometheus-*
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```


### Configuration
Prometheus is configured using a prometheus.yml file, which defines the targets and scrape intervals.

Example configuration:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'example'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

### Service Discovery
Prometheus supports service discovery for dynamic environments. Some common service discovery mechanisms are:

- Kubernetes: Automatically discovers pods and services.
- Consul: Ideal for discovering microservices.
- DNS: Discovers targets based on DNS SRV records.

Example for Kubernetes service discovery:

```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
```

### Alerting with Prometheus

Prometheus supports built-in alerting rules that can trigger alerts based on metrics. Alerts are defined in a configuration file and can be integrated with Alertmanager for more advanced notification options.

Example alert rule:

```
groups:
  - name: example-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system"} > 0.8
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU usage detected"
          description: "CPU usage is above 80% for the last 5 minutes"
```

### Best Practices
- Optimize Scrape Interval: Set appropriate scrape intervals to balance performance and data freshness.
- Use Labels Carefully: High-cardinality labels can strain Prometheus. Avoid using unique identifiers (e.g., request IDs) as labels.
- Centralize Configuration: Use a configuration management tool to maintain Prometheus configuration across environments.
- Backup Data: Although Prometheus can run without backups, consider exporting data to long-term storage for historical analysis.
- Monitor Prometheus: Prometheus provides its own metrics endpoint (/metrics), which can be monitored by another Prometheus instance.
- Integrating Prometheus into a Monitoring Stack


#### Prometheus is often used with:
  
Grafana: For advanced data visualization.
Alertmanager: For managing and routing alerts.
Thanos or Cortex: For long-term storage of metrics.
Blackbox Exporter: For probing endpoints and monitoring external systems.



#### Example stack setup:

Prometheus to collect metrics.
Grafana to visualize data.
Alertmanager to handle notifications.
Thanos to store historical data.
